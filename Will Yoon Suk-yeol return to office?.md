 Will Yoon Suk-yeol return to office?

Prediction: Yes, he will. The time is predicted to be March 2025. Here are three reasons:   
1. The constitution grants the president the authority to declare martial law, and the Constitutional Court will take this into account.
2. Public support is high, with people understanding the legitimacy of martial law and showing disdain for the radical actions of the opposition party.
3. Certain opposition forces are suspected of funneling funds to the North, posing a threat to South Koreaâ€™s national security.

South Korea is at a critical turning point in its national destiny, similar to the time of the Korean War, as the Cold War seems to be returning. At the same time, the possibility of Yoon being assassinated cannot be ruled out. In such a scenario, the conflict between the left and right factions would escalate drastically, and the left-wing forces would ultimately fail.
